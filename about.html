	<h1> About Cara Fierro <h1>
</div>

<div class="img-circular2">
	<h2>I am a Junior at Saint Josephs University in Philadelphia, but live in central New Jersey. At SJU I am studying as a communications major, which has taught me various skills and information about a range of subjects. Aside from studying communications I have an interest in art, photography, and old alternative rock & roll. As a 20 year old, I am very motivated to be successful in every task that I take on. For my future, I hope to achieve a career involved in public relations.
